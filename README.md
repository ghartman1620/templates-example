Contains a simple template example for use in Gabriel Hartman's CMPS109 Small Group Tutoring sessions.

To students: while I encourage you to copy-paste code from the professor's website on your assignments, do not do the same on code I provide you.
All of your code that you submit in any CMPS assignment is run against a plaigarism checker that, among other sources, checks that your code is not copy-pasted from a public github (like this one).
