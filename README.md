Contains a simple template example for use in Gabriel Hartman's CMPS109 Small Group Tutoring sessions.

To students: DO NOT copy paste this code in any assignment you submit. I do encourage you to use code from the professor's website however.
All of your code that you submit in any CMPS assignment is run against a plaigarism checker that, among other sources, checks that your code is not copy-pasted from a public github (like this one).

Use:

git clone https://github.com/ghartman1620/templates-example

to get a copy of this code locally to be edited, and make to build it. Note the code, as provided, does not compile.
